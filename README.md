## Trail Making Test (TMT)
The TMT is one of the most widely adopted neuropsychological tests for **assessing processing speed and executive function of an individual**. There are two subtests under TMT - TMT-A and TMT-B. Both of which require an individual to connect a series of 25 circles in a certain order.

## Digit Span Test (DST)
The DST is another commonly used neuropsychological test that assess attention efficiency, short-term memory and mental manipulation. Individuals are required to repeat verbally after the digits presented to them, depending on the actual subtest. There are three subtests, namely Digit Forward, Digit Backward and Digit Sequencing. Each differs in the way the individual repeats the digits.
